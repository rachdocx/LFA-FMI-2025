# LFA-FMI-2025

**Limbaje Formale si Automate/Computing Theory**  

This repository contains coursework, lab exercises, and research projects developed during the Computing Theory course. It includes implementations in Python and C++, covering topics such as regular expressions, finite automata, grammars, and Turing machines.

##  Repository Structure

### `Laborator/`

Contains solutions to weekly lab assignments. Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific lab session:

- **Lab 1:** Introduction to regular expressions and basic automata .
- **Lab 2:** Deterministic Finite game-like Automata (DFA) and Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) implementations.
- **Lab 3:** PDA
- **Lab 4:** 
- **Lab 5-6:** Turing Machines.

## Projects

### 1. Kolakoski Sequence

An exploration of the Kolakoski sequenceâ€”a self-generating sequence consisting of 1s and 2s where the sequence is equal to its own run-length encoding. This project includes:

- Generation algorithms for the Kolakoski sequence.
- Analysis of its properties, such as density.
- Visualizations to illustrate the sequence's structure.

### 2. Even Digits in Powers of 2

Investigates powers of 2 that consist solely of even digits in their decimal representation. The project involves:

- Algorithms to identify such powers within a given range.
- Statistical analysis of their frequency and distribution.
- Discussion on the finiteness of such numbers based on recent research.

##  Technologies Used

- **Python:** For scripting, data analysis, and prototyping algorithms.
- **C++:** For performance-critical implementations and simulations.
- **JSON files:** I thought knowing them is a important skill that is not usually learned.
